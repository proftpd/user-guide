<title>Description</title>
<para>
When proftpd processes the USER and PASS
FTP commands from a client, it has to perform checks against configured
ACLs, look up user and group information, etc.  These checks are not done
if the given username is known to not exist for the server, in order to
not tie up system resources needlessly.  However, this does mean that more
work is done when handling &quot;good&quot; users than when handling
&quot;bad&quot; users.  This difference can be detected in the time it takes
for proftpd to send a response to the USER and
PASS commands.  This means it is possible for an attacker
to look for these statistical timing differences, and determine which
users are &quot;good&quot; and which are &quot;bad&quot;.  From there,
a determined attacker can focus their attention on the known good usernames.
Note that the timings will vary depending on server load, number of
users in the user base, type of storage of user data (e.g.
LDAP directories, SQL tables, RADIUS servers, flat files, etc).

<para>
The mod_delay module attempts to prevent such timing differences
by keeping track of the time taken to process the USER and
PASS commands.  It does this for the most recent
USER and PASS commands.  The timing data are
stored in the module's DelayTable.  If the module detects
that proftpd has not taken enough time to handle one of these
commands, compared to its past response times, a small delay will be added
to the response cycle.  The amount of delay is determined by the difference
between the current time spent handling the command and the median time
spent handling the same command in the past.
