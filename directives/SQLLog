<title>Description</title>
<para>
This directive is used to log information to a database table. Multiple
SQLLog directives can be in effect for any command; for example, a user
changing directories can trigger multiple logging statements.
</para>

<para>
The first parameter to SQLLog, the cmd-set, is a comma-separated (no spaces)
list of FTP commands for which this log command will trigger. The list of
commands is too long to list in entirety; commands include CWD, DELE, HELP,
LIST, MKD, MODE, NLST, PASS, PASV, PORT and many more. For the complete list
check the FTP RFCs. Normally mod_sql will log events after they have
completed successfully; in the case of the QUIT command, mod_sql logs prior
to the server's processing of the command. (Note, however, that the client
may not issue a QUIT before logging out; in this case, use a command of EXIT
rather than QUIT. EXIT is not a real FTP command, but it is used here to
provide a means for having SQLLog work whenever a session ends.)
</para>

<para>
FTP commands in the command set will only be logged if they complete
successfully. Prefixing any command with "ERR_" will cause logging to occur
only if there was an error in the command's processing. To log both errors
and successful completion of a given command X, therefore, you'll need both
"X" and "ERR_X" in your cmd-set.
</para>

<para>
The special command "*" matches all FTP commands, while "ERR_*" matches all
errors.
</para>

<para>
The second parameter is the name of a query defined by a SQLNamedQuery
directive. The query must be an UPDATE, INSERT, or FREEFORM type query;
explicit SELECT queries will not be processed.
</para>

<para>
The third parameter is optional. If you add "IGNORE_ERRORS" as the third
parameter, SQLLog will not check for errors in the processing of the named
query. Any value for this parameter other than the string "IGNORE_ERRORS"
(case-insensitive) will not cause errors to be ignored.
</para>

<para>
Normally, SQLLog directives are considered important enough that errors in
their processing will cause mod_sql to abort the client session. References
to non-existent named queries will not abort the client session, but may
result in database corruption (in the sense that the expected database
UPDATE or INSERT will not occur). Check your directives carefully.

<title>Examples</title>
<literallayout>
  SQLLog PASS updatecount
  SQLNamedQuery updatecount UPDATE "count=count+1 WHERE userid='%u'" users
</literallayout>
<para>
together, these replicate the deprecated "SQLLoginCountField count" directive;
if the current user was "joe", this would translate into the query "UPDATE
users SET count=count+1 WHERE userid='joe'". This query would run whenever a
user was first authenticated.
</para>

<literallayout>
  SQLLog CWD updatedir
  SQLNamedQuery updatedir UPDATE "cwd='%d' where userid='%u'" users
</literallayout>
<para>
together these replicate the logging side of the deprecated "SQLLogDirs cwd"
directive; if the current user was "joe" and the current working directory
were /tmp, this would translate into the query "UPDATE users SET cwd='/tmp'
WHERE userid='joe'". This query would run whenever a user changed directories.
</para>

<literallayout>
  SQLLog RETR,STOR insertfileinfo
  SQLNamedQuery insertfileinfo INSERT "'%f', %b, '%u@%v', now()" filehistory
</literallayout>
<para>
would log the name of any file stored or retrieved, the number of bytes
transferred, the user and host doing the transfer, and the time of transfer
(at least in MySQL). This would translate into a query like: "INSERT INTO
filehistory VALUES ('somefile', 12345, 'joe@joe.org', '21-05-2001 20:01:00')"
