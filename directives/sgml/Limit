<title>Description</title>
<para>
The Limit configuration block is used to place access restrictions on one or 
more FTP commands, within a given context. Limits flow downward, so that a Limit 
configuration in the server config context applies to all &lt;Directory&gt; 
and &lt;Anonymous&gt; blocks that also 
reside in the configuration; until it is overridden by a &quot;lower&quot; &lt;Limit&gt; 
block. Any number of command parameters can be specified, 
against which the contents of the &lt;Limit&gt; block will be applied. command 
can be any valid FTP command, but is generally one of the following:
CWD (Change Working Directory)
Sent by client when changing directories.
MKD (MaKe Directory)
Sent by client to create a new directory.
RNFR (ReName FRom), RNTO (ReName TO)
Sent as a pair by client to rename a directory entry.
DELE (DELEte)
Sent by client to delete a file.
RMD (ReMove Directory)
Sent by client to remove a directory.
RETR (RETRieve)
Transfer a file from the server to the client.
STOR (STORe)
Transfer a file from the client to the server.
In addition, the following command-groups are accepted. 
They have a lower precedence than real commands, meaning that a real command 
limit will always be applied instead of the command-group.
READ
All FTP commands which deal with file reading (directory listing not included): 
  RETR, SITE, SIZE, STAT
WRITE
All FTP commands which deal with file or directory write/creation/deletion:
  APPE, DELE, MKD, RMD, RNTO, STOR, XMKD, XRMD
DIRS
All FTP commands which deal with directory listing:
  CDUP, CWD, LIST, MDTM, NLST, PWD, RNFR, XCUP, XCWD, XPWD
ALL
ALL FTP commands (identical to READ WRITE DIRS).  Note this group has the
lowest precedence of all; it will not override a limit imposed by another
command-group (e.g. DIRS).
Finally, a special command is allowed which can be used to control login access:
LOGIN
Connection or login to the server. Applying a &lt;Limit&gt; to this pseudo-command 
can be used to allow or deny initial connection or login to the context. It 
has no effect, and is ignored, when used in a context other than server config, 
&lt;VirtualHost&gt; or &lt;Anonymous&gt; 
(i.e. using it in a &lt;Directory&gt; context is 
meaningless).
&lt;Limit&gt; command restrictions should not be confused with file/directory 
access permission. While limits can be used to restrict a command on a certain 
directory, they cannot be used to override the file permissions inherent to 
the base operating/file system.
The following FTP commands cannot be restricted via &lt;Limit&gt;:
  ABOR
  HELP
  MODE (not implemented, always S)
  NOOP
  PASS (use &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;)
  PASV
  PORT
  QUIT
  REST (use AllowRetrieveRestart, AllowStoreRestart)
  STRU (not implemented, always F)
  SYST
  TYPE
  USER (use &lt;Limit LOGIN&gt;)
